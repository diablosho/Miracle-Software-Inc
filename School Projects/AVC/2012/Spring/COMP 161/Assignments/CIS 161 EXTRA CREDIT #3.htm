    <TD>Create a program that will simulate the dealing of a five card hand. 
      Your program should use a two dimensional array of <B>ints</B> called 
      <I>deck</I> for the deck of cards. One column will be the card value, and 
      the other will represent the suit value. Your program should include a two 
      dimensional array of <B>ints</B> called <I>hand</I> for the hand using 
      basically the same format as the deck but with only 5 rows. Once you have 
      populated the deck (using a function) call a function to "shuffle" the 
      deck. Call a function to deal five cards from the deck to the hand. There 
      should be a variable in main (which will be passed to and updated by deal) 
      that keeps track of the index of the next card available in the deck. 
      Initially, the first available card is at index 0, but as cards are dealt, 
      that value changes. Your program should show the contents of the hand 
      after it is dealt (using a function). For example: 
      <P>Ace of clubs<BR>5 of diamonds<BR>Queen of hearts<BR>10 of spades<BR>2 
      of clubs<BR><BR>Allow the user to choose one card to throw away by 
      entering a number from 1 to 5 indicating the position of the card they 
      want to discard. The program should then replace that card with a new one 
      from the deck and re-display the hand. <BR>For an additional 5 points, 
      allow the user to enter one line of digits (1-5) separated by spaces 
      indicating up to 4 cards they would like to replace, replace those cards 
      and re-display the hand. If the user enters<BR>1 3 5<BR>the program should 
      replace the 1st, 3rd and 5th card. If any of the digits are outside the 
      range 1-5, or there are more than 4 numbers entered, the user should 
      receive an error message and be asked to re-enter their choices.

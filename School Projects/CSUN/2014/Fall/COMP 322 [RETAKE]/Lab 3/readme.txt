Original (9/27/2014 @ 00:19):
-This program is working perfectly.
-I was having issues with a Memory Fault (I was looping too far through the arguments, out-of-bounds)
-I was also having issues with my Handler-Function not even running, but figured that out as well (my strcmp(char*, char*) function wasn't implemented correctly)

Implemented:
-getpid()
-handler function
-Output to Screen

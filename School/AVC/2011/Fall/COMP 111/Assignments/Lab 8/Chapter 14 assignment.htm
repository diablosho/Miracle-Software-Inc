<BODY><FONT face=helvetica>Study sections 14.1-14.3 stopping on page 858 where 
it discusses <B>Handling Events in an Applet.</B> Continue with section 
14.5.<BR><BR>Once you understand the concept of creating an Applet within a web 
page and the shape drawing methods, modify code listing 14-11 and create your 
own drawing using some of the methods in Table 14-2 (pages 869-870). BE CREATIVE 
and HAVE FUN. You can create some really interesting designs with very simple 
code if you include <B>for</B> loops, but you are not required to use <B>for</B> 
loops.<BR><BR>Turn in a printout of your HTML page code, your Java Applet code, 
and a screen capture of your drawing. The screen capture can be done by using 
the <B>P</B>rint option on the <B>F</B>ile menu of your browser.

Write a program that asks the user to enter four integers. Using ONLY
4 if statements, the program should output the largest and smallest

then output the dates in order.
Here is a sample run. User input is enclosed in brackets:

Enter first date (mm/dd/yyyy): [03/06/2008]
Enter second date (mm/dd/yyyy): [05/17/2007]
05/17/2007 is earlier than 03/06/2008



Make sure you document your code extensively!
Your name should appear as the first line of your documentation.
The chapter number should be the second line of your documentation.
Make sure your program is user friendly.
Turn in one copy of your code and at least three different "runs."

CIS 161 Chapter 4 Part II assignment

Choose one of the following projects:

#1
Write a program that calculates a person's pay given the following:
Pay for day 1 is 1 cent. Each day worked, the pay doubles.
Your program should ask for the number of days worked and then print a
pay schedule. Here is a sample run.

How many days do you plan on working? [10]

DAY	  PAY	    TOTAL
 1       0.01        0.01
 2       0.02        0.03
 3       0.04        0.07
 4       0.08        0.15
 5       0.16        0.31
 6       0.32        0.63
 7       0.64        1.27
 8       1.28        2.55
 9       2.56        5.11
10       5.12       10.23

Press any key to continue.

Your program should not allow the user to enter a number greater than 31
or less than 5. Your program should continue to prompt the user for a valid
number of days if they enter a number outside the range 5-31.


#2
Write a program that asks the user to enter a series of numbers (one at a time)
where all the numbers are between 1 and 100 inclusive. The user ends the program 
by entering a number outside that range. The program should then output all the 
integers from the smallest integer entered to the largest integer entered.

Here is a sample run:

Please enter a series of integers between 1 and 100 inclusive.
Entering a number outside that range will end the input process:?[45]
?[55]
?[44]
?[56]
?[-1]

Process returned 0 (0x0)   execution time : 23.078 s
Press any key to continue.

Make sure you document your code extensively!
Your name should appear as the first line of your documentation.
The chapter number should be the second line of your documentation.
Make sure your program is user friendly.
Turn in one copy of your code and at least three different "runs."

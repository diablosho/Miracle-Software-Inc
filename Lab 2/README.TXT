Original (9/21/2014 @ 23:15):
-I created a custom Header file where I can put commonly used functions I write.  It's called "ProcessFunctions.h".
-Still trying to fix these Memory Faults in the tube.c project

Implemented:
-launch.c works properly (no errors have been found as of yet during debugging)
-tube.c:
-	The program will concatenate the arguments passed into the command-line, but if I try to separate the arguments into separate commands I get Memory Faults...

Still to be implemented:
-Pretty much everything in tube.c.
-I cannot seem to figure out these Memory Fault problems I keep having...
-I disabled most of the features in tube.c regarding forking to attempt to debug the memory-faults I'm getting.
